This is a demonstration of the use of R to solve a simple, common, yet often frustrating office situation: the presence of two similar but not identical spreadsheets that need to be reconciled. There are ways to do this in Microsoft Excel, but many users of R prefer to maximize the use of R, while minimizing the use of Excel. By using the `dplyr` package, this can be accomplished in very few lines of code.


Note that for the purposes of this demonstration, the package `pander` is also used. This package is only used here to generate more attractive tables, and plays no functional role in the manipulation of the data.


For purposes of comparison, a similar demonstration performed using Microsoft Excel is included in this repository. See DuplicatesExcelDemo.pdf for more information.
